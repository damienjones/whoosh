*whoosh*
========

A JavaScript zoom animation player.

*whoosh* is designed to play back "zoom" animations, such as a fractal zoom animation. It requires that zoom keyframe images are already generated; they will then be fetched, positioned, and scaled, smoothly interpolated, to play back the results.

This repository does not include any code to *generate* the keyframe images.

The original *whoosh* player was written in Flash, because at the time it was the best playback option. Flash is not supported on mobile devices, and Flash is less than ideal in many other ways, so this project is all about rebuilding it using HTML and JavaScript.
