## Feature Branches

### feature/control-logic

Not about UI; this is the underlying logic to support easing, using the correct number of frames based on current canvas size, rotation, and configuration controls.

### feature/prototype [DONE]

Rough working prototype showing zoom animation from start to finish. Doesn't have to be pretty, or offer any UI, or even fully work with ease-in/ease-out, just show the core, working zoom mechanic.
